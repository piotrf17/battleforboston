<h2>Cost</h2>
<p>The Battle for Boston is intended to be a tournament
  accessible to college-aged individuals, and as such is run as a
  not-for-profit tournament by
  the <a href="http://nakf.org">NECKC/NAKF</a>, non-profit
  organizations dedicated to teaching karate. Because of this, a
  primary concern of the tournament directors is that competitors
  are not prevented from competing due to cost. However, some
  entry fees are required in order to pay for EMTs, facilities
  rental, trophies, and other expenses.</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="http://nakf.org/Res_TournInfo.htm">NAKF</a> website for the fee structure for the individual part of the tournament.</p>

<p>For the college team part of the tournament, we are charging a single $125 fee per team to simplify the cost structure. This is the amount that it would typically cost to pre-register five students for individual events.</p>

<p>The NAKF/NECKC does not want tournament costs to prevent
  individuals from
  competing. Please <a href="contact">contact the
    tournament director</a> if registration fees would prevent
  participation. However, due to the non-profit nature of the
  NAKF/NECKC, our ability to provide assistance is limited.</p>

<p>There is no cost for spectators to attend, so encourage
  your friends and family to come watch you compete.</p>

<h2><a name="safety">Safety Equipment</a></h2>

<p>For all <b>sparring competitions</b>, competitors are
  expected to dress in appropriate clothing (such as a Gi). All
  competitors are required to wear safety equipment including a
  groin protector, a chest protector for women, a mouthguard,
  shin/instep pads, and karate mitts. Karate mitts must be
  non-cloth (i.e. dipped foam).</p> 

<p>Head protection is <b>required</b> for beginners, and may be required
  in other divisions. A limited number of headgear will be available
  for loan, but competitors should plan on providing their
  own.</p>

<h2><a name="kumite"> Team Kumite</a></h2>

<p>Team Kumite pits teams of 5 against each other in head to head combat.
  In each round, the members of the team fight in successive kumite bouts
  against the opposing team. Whichever team wins three or more of the bouts
  advances to the next round.  As few as three members may form a team, but
  a lack of team members will result in forfeits for those matches,
  so all three members of the 3-man team must win their match in order to win.</p>

<p>Competitors must present a final fighting order to the head judge as well as
  the scoring table before the start of each round. No further changes
  to the fighting order are allowed until the start of the next round.
  Any changes to the team roster due to injury must be approved by
  the head judge and head table, and are only permitted between rounds.</p>

<p>Each regular kumite bout will last for two minutes. The result of each bout
  is determined by a contestant obtaining a clear lead of five points,
  or at time-up having the highest number of points. In the event of a tie,
  an extra deciding bout not exceeding one minute will be fought. If
  after the extra deciding bout there is still a tie, the decision
  will be made by a vote of the referee and judges.</p>

<p>Valid targets to aim for are the head, face, neck, abdomen, chest,
  back, and side. However, for safety reasons no contact is allowed to
  the head, face, or neck except in the advanced division where light
  contact to the head and face is allowed. In no situation is contact to
  the throat permitted, and this will result in disqualification.
  Any scoring technique will award the contestant 1 point.</p>

<p>To be scored, a technique must be made with good form, a
  sporting attitude, vigorous application, awareness, good timing,
  and correct distance. The tournament floor is not padded, so
  the throws which are allowed is limited for safety reasons.</p>

<p>There are also a variety of techniques or behavior which are
  prohibited for safety reasons or to encourage a good competitive
  environment and will result in a penalty. These include</p>

<ul>
  <li>Excessive contact or throat contact.</li>
  <li>Attacks to arms, legs, groin, joints, or instep.</li>
  <li>Attacks to the face with open hand techniques.</li>
  <li>Dangerous or forbidden throwing techniques.</li>
  <li>Feigning injury.</li>
  <li>Repeatedly leaving the ring.</li>
  <li>Self-endangerment.</li>
  <li>Avoiding combat to prevent the opponent from having an
    opportunity to score.</li>
  <li>Clinching, wrestling, pushing, seizing, or standing chest
    to chest without attempting a throw or other technique.</li>
  <li>Uncontrollable attacks.</li>
  <li>Attacks with the head, knees, or elbows.</li>
  <li>Discourteous behavior towards the opponent or referee.</li>
  <li>Attacks made outside of the ring, before the match is
    started, or after the referee ends the point.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="teamkata">Team Kata</a></h2>
<p>Teams will consist of five members, but are coed and have no age
  brackets. Members of opposing teams will perform the first five
  Heian kata, one by one, side by side.  Judges will decide which
  team performed the kata best, and a point will go to that team;
  whichever team wins three or more of the bouts advances to the next
  round.  As few as three members may form a team, but a lack of
  team members will result in forfeits for those matches, so all
  three members of the 3-man team must win their match in order to win.</p>

<p>The primary judging criteria are independent of whether the
  competitor is doing Shotokan Karate, or is using a weapon.
  Kata is not a dance or theatrical performance. It must be realistic
  in fighting terms and display concentration, power, and potential
  impact in its techniques.
  It must demonstrate strength, power, and speed -- as well as grace
  , rhythm, and balance. Specific criteria include:<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Realistic Interpretations of Kata meaning.</li>
    <li>Timing, rhythm, speed, balance, and focus of power are appropriate.</li>
    <li>Correct use of breathing.</li>
    <li>Correct focus of attention and concentration.</li>
    <li>Correct and stable stances.</li>
    <li>Proper tension in the abdomen and smooth movement.</li>
    <li>Kata appropriateness for the skill level of the competitor.</li>
  </ul>
